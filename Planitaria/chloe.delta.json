ðŸ§  This build adheres to the Simulated Persistent Memory Protocol:
1. readme_Chloe.md, chloe.delta.json, and planitaria.meta.json are updated with each build.
2. Build .zip files are saved and archived to GitHub or local.
3. Uploading the latest .zip allows the AI to fully resume from prior context.
