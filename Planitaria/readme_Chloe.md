## Phase: Roadmap to Official 1.0 Release

**Status:** Consolidation validated; ready to advance the core build toward a polished, production‑ready 1.0.

---

## 1. Summary of Current State

* **Core modules (100%)** are in place and integrated: index.html, style.css, React entry (PlannerApp.jsx), gridEngine, stencilLoader, saveManager, overlayManager, tutorialSystem, uiStateManager.
* **Basic PWA stubs** exist: manifest.json, favicon.ico.
* **Gamepack scaffold**: gamepacks/Satisfactory/stencils.json placeholder is present.
* **Analysis** indicates \~60% feature completeness toward interactive, user‑friendly 1.0.

**Total Estimated Duration:** \~10 weeks

## 3. Consolidation & Clean Directory

Prior to each phase, run the consolidation script to:

1. Remove any extraneous files or duplicate directories.
2. Ensure only the following reside at top level of `/planitaria/`:

   * index.html, style.css, PlannerApp.jsx
   * gridEngine.js, stencilLoader.js, saveManager.js, overlayManager.js, tutorialSystem.js, uiStateManager.js
   * manifest.json, favicon.ico
   * gamepacks/Satisfactory/stencils.json
   * planitaria.meta.json, session\_heartbeat.txt, readme\_Chloe.md
3. Commit the clean state to GitHub before starting each milestone.

---

## 4. Next Immediate Action

* **Begin Phase 1: Stencil Placement & Scene Graph**

  1. **Canvas drop zone**: Add event listeners for `dragover` and `drop` on `#grid-canvas`.
  2. **Data model**: Update `stencilLoader.js` and global `window.planitariaState.stencils` array to record placed stencils (type, x, y, rotation).
  3. **Rendering**: In `gridEngine.js`, draw placed stencil shapes/icons on the canvas at grid-snapped coordinates.
  4. **State persistence**: Ensure new placements are included in the save/export JSON.
  5. **Logging**: After each placement handler implementation, add a lockpoint entry in this README.

**Lockpoint for Phase 1 start:** 15 MAY 2025 - 17:05 EDT

**Let me know when you’re ready and I’ll scaffold the code for drop handlers and scene graph updates.**

## 5. GitHub Repository Packaging

**Goal:** Package the complete Planitaria build into a GitHub repository structure:

* **README.md** at the root, with usage and setup instructions.
* **.gitignore** to exclude non-essential files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `*.zip`).
* **planitaria/** directory containing all core runtime files, assets, gamepacks, and metadata.

**Deliverable:** `Planitaria_Repo_1.0.zip` — ready to drag & drop onto your GitHub repo to replace the existing structure.

**Lockpoint:** 15 MAY 2025 - 17:10 EDT

## 6. GitHub Repository Analysis & Recommendations

After reviewing your GitHub at `WylieH2SC/plan-the-beast/Planitaria`, the current repository reflects the cleaned structure we defined. To move forward efficiently, consider the following next steps:

1. **Issue Tracking & Milestones**

   * Create GitHub Issues for each Phase milestone (Stencil Placement, Context Menus, Overlays, etc.).
   * Set up a project board or Milestones to track progress and assign issues.

2. **Local Testing Setup**

   * Add a simple `npm` or `yarn` script to serve `planitaria/` (e.g., using `serve` or `http-server`) to streamline local development.
   * Document this in `README.md` under “Development”.

3. **Continuous Integration**

   * Configure GitHub Actions to run a basic HTML/CSS/JS linting check on push.
   * Optionally, deploy to GitHub Pages automatically when commits land on `main`.

4. **Project Documentation**

   * Flesh out `README.md` with live screenshots, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
   * Move technical deep-dive into a `docs/` folder if needed, preserving `readme_Chloe.md` for internal continuity.

5. **Code Quality & Testing**

   * Introduce ESLint with a consistent style guide (e.g., Airbnb) for JS/JSX.
   * Set up simple unit tests for pure logic (e.g., grid snap calculations) using Jest.

6. **Versioning & Releases**

   * Tag the current commit as `v1.0.0-beta` in GitHub Releases.
   * Draft release notes summarizing the build status and known gaps (as per `readme_Chloe.md`).

7. **Roadmap Integration**

   * Publish the roadmap table (from Section 2) into a `ROADMAP.md` file.
   * Link it from `README.md` so contributors understand the project trajectory.

8. **Contribution Workflow**

   * Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for submitting PRs, code style, and testing requirements.

**Lockpoint for GitHub setup:** 15 MAY 2025 - 17:15 EDT

---

## 7. Next Steps on GitHub

* Create the issues and project board described above.
* Add CI workflows and deploy scripts.
* Update documentation files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ROADMAP.md`).

**End of GitHub Analysis**

## 8. Internal Update Protocol

To ensure **complete integrity and continuity**, all future changes to this file must follow these rules:

1. **Append-Only**: Never delete or overwrite existing sections. Always append new update logs or sections at the end of the document under new headings or lockpoints.
2. **Timestamped Lockpoints**: Each new update must begin with a lockpoint line in the format:

   ```
   Lockpoint: DD MMM YYYY - HH:MM EDT
   ```
3. **Section Headers**: Introduce new content under clearly numbered or titled sections (e.g., `## 9. Phase X Updates`).
4. **Change Logs**: For each update, include a brief change log bullet list describing the modifications or new directives.
5. **Version Tracking**: Maintain a simple semantic version notation at the top (e.g., `version: 1.0.1`) whenever substantial updates occur.
6. **Preserve Context**: Retain all prior text exactly as-is to allow ChatGPT or any automated agent to parse the full history.

**Example for future update:**

```
Lockpoint: 16 MAY 2025 - 09:00 EDT
## 9. Added Phase 2 Schedule
- Defined detailed schedule for context menu integration
- Updated ETA for Phase 2 to 1.5 weeks
version: 1.0.1
```

These conventions guarantee that the state of Planitaria and its development history are always recoverable and machine-readable.

**End of Internal Update Protocol**
