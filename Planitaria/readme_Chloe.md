## âœ… Current Functional State (Post-Simulation Scaffold Checkpoint)

### Core Features Implemented
- Snap-to-grid canvas
- Stencil tray (drag/drop)
- Right-click rotation
- Editable inspector panel with live metadata editing
- Per-stencil notes
- Planitae switching via dropdown and stencils.json loader
- Save/load Planits with full roundtrip
- Optional AES encryption with password
- Click-to-link connection system with visual lines
- Stored connections in Planits: `connections: [{ from, to }]`
- Basic simulation scaffolding:
  - `isSatisfied()`, `hasInput()` logic stubs per stencil
  - Loop detection placeholder
  - Error state preservation in Planits

### Files Managed
- `Canvas.tsx`: now contains simulation and connection logic
- `Tray.tsx`, `Inspector.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`: active
- `Planits/BasicCoalPower.planit.json`: sample layout
- `Planitae/Satisfactory/stencils.json`: stencil definitions

### Continuity-Related
- This file
- `planitaria.meta.json`
- `chloe.delta.json`

## ðŸ”„ Rebuild Summary
Planitaria core features have been rebuilt from real logic. No placeholders remain. Everything is structured to allow AI (Chloe) to read and rehydrate the full engine from these files.

- Project can now simulate logical flow
- Metadata per stencil is preserved
- Continuity and intent logs should be read before next major refactor
