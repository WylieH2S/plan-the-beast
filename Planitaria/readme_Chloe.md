**Instructions for AI/Chloe:**
- ALWAYS update this file with each code contribution or feature slice.
- Log all changes in detail, including filenames, feature context, and architectural notes.
- State the *next intended step* or priority at the end of each entry.
- Preserve prior log entries; never delete history.
- Update this housekeeping section if instructions for file management or AI protocol change.
