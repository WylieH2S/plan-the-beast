## âœ… Current Functional State (Post-Diagnostic Overlay Checkpoint)

### Fully Implemented Systems
- Canvas with snap-to-grid placement
- Stencil tray (drag/drop)
- Right-click rotation
- Editable Inspector (type, position, rotation, notes)
- Planitae switching system (loads stencils.json dynamically)
- Save/load Planits with full metadata and localStorage fallback
- Optional AES encryption for Planit export
- Visual connection system (click to link, directional arrows)
- Logic simulation flow (isSatisfied, role + direction traversal)
- Tooltip overlays (hover info: type, role, state)
- Error flags for unsatisfied logic inputs
- Overlay toggle (checkbox)
- Continuity metadata fully integrated

### Files Tracked
- Canvas.tsx: diagnostic overlays, connection lines, sim flow
- Tray.tsx, Inspector.tsx, App.tsx, main.tsx: UI components
- stencils.json, planit.json, satisfactory.planitae.json
- readme_Chloe.md, chloe.delta.json, planitaria.meta.json

### Notes
- Planitaria is now functionally able to place, edit, connect, simulate, and debug basic logical flow.
- Diagnostic layers confirm system-level awareness and Planit integrity.
