## 🧠 PURPOSE

This file is the central continuity memory for the Planitaria project. It is intended to serve as a self-contained, AI-parsable, versioned project memory. It contains:
- Project identity and authorship
- Full state reconstruction logic
- Module and development status
- Historical logs
- Rebuild protocol and logic flags
- Licensing references

This file replaces all other memory files for AI continuity.
